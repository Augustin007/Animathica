# Animathica
Animated math calculator based on Alan Becker's [Animation Vs Math](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1J6Ou4q8vE&ab_channel=AlanBecker)

I've opened up [discussions](https://github.com/Augustin007/Animathica/discussions). Stuff happens there for now.

Nothing to see here just yet.

My default language for proof-of-concepts is Python because I am very familiar with the language. I might also try Lisp as I have recently fallen in love with it, though I am less familiar with how it works.

I'm not at all familiar with anything to do with graphics.
