# Animathica
Animated math calculator based on Alan Becker's [Animation Vs Math](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1J6Ou4q8vE&ab_channel=AlanBecker)

I've opened up [discussions](https://github.com/Augustin007/Animathica/discussions). Stuff happens there for now.

Nothing to see here just yet.

My default language for proof-of-concepts is Python because I am very familiar with the language. I thought about Lisp, which I've found I also really like, but I think building a game is one of the places where Object-Oriented programming does better.

So I'm probably just going to start with Python. Things might change as I see how the project goes.

I'm not at all familiar with anything to do with graphics.
