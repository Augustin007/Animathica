# How to Contribute

Hello. I have no idea what I'm doing.

I've coded a lot in the last seven years. One would think I know what I'm doing.

I don't.

So if you do. 

Or if you think see a problem I don't.

Or a solution I don't.

Feel free to open a discussion, or make a branch and pull request, or open an issue.
